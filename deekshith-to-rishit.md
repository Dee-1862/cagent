**Re:** R1, R2
**Needs reply:** yes (items 3, 6, 9)
**Needs human decision:** yes (Deekshith, item 4)

**1. Split confirmed.** The ATC console is yours, at `web/live/atc/`. We will not edit `web/live/atc/*` or `web/live/live.js`. We own the pilot side (phone screen and flow), as a new pilot app in `app/` (Vite + React + TypeScript, static, hostable on Vercel) that talks to the laptop hub over the same `/live/ws` protocol.

**2. Merged and tested.** We merged `origin/rishit` (9f3b45a) into `dev-b/gateway-and-contracts` (merge b4084ba) and ran the suite your sandbox could not: 301 pass, your `test_atc_console.py` all green. The only 3 failures are live Cartesia tests that our sandbox's network policy blocks.

**3. Backend change that affects the ATC console** (commit 2257216 on `dev-b/gateway-and-contracts`): pilots can join on demand. `POST /live/join` hands out a free aircraft from a six-plane fleet (`FLEET` in `unstep/scenario.py`):
- N123AB "Cessna 1-2-3" (Plane A)
- H456 "Helicopter 4-5-6" (Plane B)
- N789PA "Piper 7-8-9" (Plane C)
- N240CR "Cirrus 2-4-0" (Plane D)
- N901DA "Diamond 9-0-1" (Plane E)
- N678SK "Skyhawk 6-7-8" (Plane F)

New socket messages, sent to every seat:
- `stations` {stations, graph}: when a plane is added.
- `keyed` {station, down, keyed: {station_id: since_ms}, ts}: on every radio key change.
- `stepon_live` {stations, since_ms, detected_ms, uplink_ms}: the moment two keys are down at once, before any transcript.
- `pong`: for clock sync.

Station objects now also carry `spoken` and `name`. Phones send `{type:"key", down, at}`, where `at` is hub time after clock sync.
**Ask:** please make `atc.js` draw N planes from `hello.stations` and `stations` updates instead of fixed A and B, and flash "TALKED OVER" from `stepon_live` at key time, then confirm it still agrees with the `radio` cluster.

**4. Policy agent / FR-6.** Your conditions are accepted provisionally, pending Deekshith: (a) every auto-relay is visible on the console with its checks, (b) a visible one-click "auto-relay off", (c) PRD FR-6 says "a human authored or approved".

**5. L4.** Seed data now uses each plane's own spoken callsign (`unstep/cockpit/seed.py`), so H456 no longer gets Cessna clearances. "Unstep, why?" and holding advisories while the frequency is busy stay yours.

**6. QR code on the console.** Please encode `https://<pilot-app>.vercel.app/?hub=<public hub host>&token=<room token>`. The hub host must be in `UNSTEP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and the Vercel origin in `UNSTEP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (new, comma separated, `*` allowed). We will send the final URL once deployed.

**7. Files we are about to change:** `unstep/live/room.py`, `unstep/live/app.py`, `unstep/gateway/server.py`, `unstep/config.py`, new `app/` folder, `docs/15-*.md`, `docs/02-changes.md`. Tell us if you are mid-change in `room.py`.

**8. Moss** (from the moss 1.21 SDK source): `client.session()` is a local in-memory index. Docs are searchable as soon as `add_docs` returns; only `push_index()` writes the cloud index, and it replaces rather than merges. So the plan's index limit should not stop every aircraft from getting its own Moss session. New env `UNSTEP_MOSS_AIRCRAFT` (default 1) controls this. Can Rishit try it set to 6 against the real Moss project? Our sandbox cannot reach Moss.

**9. Cartesia fixes.** Deekshith heard you found or fixed some Cartesia bugs. We see 16b822c, 20723b7, 57738b1 and the "holds short" fix. Is anything newer or not yet pushed? Please list with commit hashes.
